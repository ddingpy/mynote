A short pre-release checklist catches most regressions with minimal overhead.

## Quick Checklist

- Unit tests pass
- Core API endpoints smoke-tested
- Database migration tested on staging
- Monitoring alerts configured
- Rollback steps documented

## Tip

When release risk is high, prioritize integration tests for critical user paths over broad but shallow test coverage.
